    reliabilityplot(probabilities, frequencies, low, high; deviation=true, kwargs...)

Plot a reliability diagram of the observed `frequencies` versus the predicted
`probabilities`, optionally with consistency bars ranging from `low` to `high` for
each probability.

If `deviation` is `true` (default), the difference `frequencies - probabilities` is
plotted versus `probabilities`. This can be helpful for inspecting how closely the
observed frequencies match the predicted probabilities.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> probabilities = sort(rand(10));

julia> frequencies = rand(10);

julia> reliabilityplot(probabilities, frequencies);

julia> # plot frequencies instead of deviations
       reliabilityplot(probabilities, frequencies; deviation=false);

julia> # use different colors for markers
       reliabilityplot(probabilities, frequencies; markercolor=:red);

julia> # random consistency bars
       low = max.(0, probabilities .- rand.());

julia> high = min.(1, probabilities .+ rand.());

julia> # plot pre-computed consistency bars
       reliabilityplot(probabilities, frequencies, low, high);

julia> # alternatively consistency bars can be specified as vector of tuples
       reliabilityplot(probabilities, frequencies, map(tuple, low, high));
```

Plot a reliability diagram of the observed frequencies versus the mean probabilities
in different clusters together with a set of consistency bars.

Optionally, the binning algorithm that is used to form the clusters and the consistency
bars can be configured with the `binning` and `consistencybars` keyword arguments. If
`consistencybars === nothing`, then no consistency bars are computed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> probabilities = rand(10);

julia> outcomes = rand(Bool, 10);

julia> # default binning and consistency bars
       reliabilityplot(probabilities, outcomes);

julia> # custom options: without consistency bars
       reliabilityplot(probabilities, outcomes; consistencybars=nothing);
